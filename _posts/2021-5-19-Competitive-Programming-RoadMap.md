# Before We Start

1. Learn the basic syntax of a language (python, c++, java, etc)
2. Learn the STD (built in) libraries of that language
3. Start learning Algorithms
   - Alternate between, one day learning, one day practicing.
   - Use youtube and blogs to learn Algorithms.
   - Use A2OJ ladder, Codeforces, leetocde, Hackerearch, online contests and SPOJ to practice Algorithms.
   - Learn Big O notation

# Competitive Programming Roadmap

- ### Do a bunch of pattern problems on codeforces

  (It improves understanding of loop and your thinking)

- ### Linear Search and circular array

- ### Palindrome, perfect, armstrong number
  (understand how to do basic number problems)
- ### Simple hashing problems

- ### Prefix sum problems

- ### Sliding Window Technique

- ### Binary Search

- ### Number Theory

  - GCD of two numbers in Log N time  
    (Euclidean and extended Euclidean Algorithms)
  - Linear Diophantine Equation
  - Checking Primes in sqrt(n) time  
    (Sieve of Eratosthenes and Segmented Sieve)
  - Finding prime factorization of a numebr in log N time per query  
    (Euler Totient Function, Fermat little Theorem, Wilson's Theorem)
  - Finding x^n in log n time
  - Modular Arithmetic
  - Modular Inverse of a numeber
  - Modular Exponentiation
  - Chinese Remainder Theorem
  - Factorial Modulo mod
  - Finding nCr and nPr for queries in O(1) time
  - Inclusion and Exclusion principle

- ### Basic Sorting Algorithms

  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Merge sort
  - Heapsort
  - Quicksort
  - Shellsort
  - Do problems with constructive and term swap tags on codeforces.

- ### 2-pointer

- ### Bit Manipulation (right shift, left shift, set bit, MSB, LSB, etc)

- ### Power set of a given array or string using Bit

- ### Numbers of Subarray with XOR as zero (must do problem)

- ### Greedy

  - Kadane's algorithm
  - Job Sequencing problem
  - Activity Selection problem

- ### Recursion
  - Finding factorial using recursion
  - implement Binary Search using recursion
  - Implement modular Exponentiation using recursion
  - Finding subset with given sum using recursion
- ### Merge sort
- ### Quick sort
- ### Backtracking problems (Sudoko, N queue (helps with DP path problems))
- ### Meet in the middle algorithms
- ### Divide and Conquer problems
- ### Next greater element/ next smaller element using stack
- ### Problems related to paranthesis
- ### Largest Rectangular area in Histogram (concept is important)
- ### Problems related to Heap (use priority heap)

## Harder Algorithms

### This is the point where most programmers give up. Problems from this point and onwards will take much longer time to solve (4-5 hrs). You must invest time and never give up! You must do at least 30 problems on each of the topics to remember them.

- ### Hashing on string and solve problems, understand when collisions happens
- ### Rabin Karp Algorithm
- ### Prefix Karp Algorithm
- ### KMP Algorithm
- ### Z-funcion
- ### Manacher's Algorithm
- ### Tree
  - Graph representation
  - DFS/BFS traversal in graph/tree
  - Basics of tree (height, diameter level)
  - Euler tour of tree
  - LCA using Euler tour
  - LCA using binary lifting
  - Distance between two nodes
  - Subtree problems
- ### Graph
  - Connected components
  - Topological sort
  - Cycle detection in graph
  - Bipartite check in graph
  - SCC using kosaraju's algorithm
  - Dijkstra's algorithm
  - Bellman ford algorithm
  - Floyd Warshall algorithm
  - Bridges in graph
  - Articulation point in graph
  - Minimum spanning tree, using Krusjal's algorithm
  - Prim's algorithm
  - 0/1 BFS (important)
  - Finding bridges online
- ### Dynamic Programming
  - Get strong in recursion
  - Understand memoization
  - Solve all DP problems (LCS, knacpsack etc)
  - Use Atcoder Educational Contests on DP (25 problems)
  - Solve DP problems using SPOJ
