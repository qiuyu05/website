<p>
  I am obsessed with chess. I have started playing chess since I was three years
  old back in my native country (China). Even though, I started playing chess at
  such a young age, I have not accomplished anything in chess yet. My goal is to
  achieve a FIDE master before I graduate from high school.

  This study is based on the book, <i>Amateur to IM</i> by Jonathan Hawkins. It
  talks about all the endgames that you need to know. The drawback is that it
  does not go in deeply in each of the endgames.
